3786,7-Mar-16,"Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse & worse until the point of being unbearable when it wouldn't even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement & came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues & they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??",1

6734,17-Jun-17,"Because of Spotify, I will never use Pandora again. Spotify is great, because it allows you to build your own playlist(s) and you're not forced to listen to songs that really don't suit your mood. I have Spotify on all of my devices.",1

2754,30-Dec-14,I just wish it was free lol,0
5621,22-Dec-16,"I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!",1
2113,1-Aug-15,solid!,1
6228,20-Aug-17,"Very rapid download,",1
5927,17-Apr-15,"A friend at work turned me into this. Amazing free app! Love the genres it offers. Has me listening to artists I've never heard of and loving them. If you like most types of music this is a great app. If you're a fan whose open to new listening experiences, you'll find it so valuable you'll want to install it on every device you have and never be without one so you can listen all the time!!",1
5445,21-Jun-17,Why did I wait so long to try Spotify? The current 99 cents for 3 months deal pushed me over the edge. I may not be able to look back. The app works great on my Android phone and Kindle. But where it really shines is on my Echo.,1
1628,18-Sep-14,"I'm no illustrious author, but if you love music, this is the best app out there.",1
4328,19-Jan-16,Spotify won't let me register I have tried at least 20 times but it won't let me register I would give it zero stars but I can't.,0
6407,27-Apr-16,"I've had many music apps pandora, musify, music downloader, iTunes:( but spotify is by far the best one ever lots of stations, artists, every song I've ever looked up! Plus you get to create your own playlists!!!",1

5001,23-Apr-17,"Idk I only like Spotify because of how much music they have, that's an ok amount.. There's way to many ads and they're too long, this isn't TV, these aren't commercial break.. these ads don't need to be 4 mins long.. For a few 3 minute songs.. That's horrible, Spotify makes me wanna Kermit __",0

2649,3-Jan-15,"Amazing and I love,love,love.",1
5093,27-Jun-15,"THE best music app of all! I was a subscriber to a monthly music service for years. Then I found out about Spotify. I had several gigabytes of music files on my computer and in the cloud. When I found Spotify, I made the decisione to get rid of all that and save space on my hard drive.You don't actually BUY the music, so you can't burn CDs or make other copies, but you CAN have the app on all your devices, so the music goes with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials! You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you don't have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you're listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you're listening to.
 
 And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well. I don't use those features, but they are available.
 
 This is the app I use more than any other on my devices. I just love it.",1

3783,18-Jul-16,"We were motivated to update our online library when we got our Echo, because songs from our library are available on request with the device. Unfortunately, it appears that there is no way to upload data from an audio CD (from our physical home library). It may be that there is a way to do this, but we were unable to figure out how to do so. In iTunes, it is simply a matter of inserting an audio CD while the application is running. In addition, there is evidently a 250 song limit on the number of songs you can upload into the Spotify cloud database, unless you are willing to pay ten bucks a month to upgrade the service.",0
7263,1-Aug-17,Makes me happy,1
4062,14-Oct-16,"This shuts down my new Apple desktop, for some reason! It always has! And it probably always will...It's probably because you're trying to install malware on my system!!! And my system is like coughing like a 100 year old man, & passes out* Since it freezes FIRST, before shutting down. I noticed this after an update too...Hmmm...So YES, you read that right folks! They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I don't use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist (online or off) has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, & always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit ""Home"" before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it & selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you're also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!",0
4375,1-Nov-15,"This app is the worst music app in the history of apps,please give us free music and unlimited skips RIGHT ABOUT NOW!",0
5097,12-Aug-16,"I use Spotifyt all the time, and I have a favorite playlist on Spotify that I listen to each morning when I read the paper. Spotify doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of iTunes or Amazon Music; but the search feature is easy to use, and it's very easy to create and modify playlists. I especially like the fact that it plays through my Amazon Echo.",1

6966,24-Mar-16,"Stops after two or three songs, even when entire playlist is downloaded. Uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times already, no luck. Love that I can create my own playlists. I subscribe to both Spotify and Pandora, one for playlists of specific songs I already know, the other when I want to explore stuff I haven't heard before.",0
2134,6-Aug-14,I love it. But I wish it was easier to shut off when you are done with it.,1
