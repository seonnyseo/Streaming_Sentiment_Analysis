11902,13-May-17,"With Unlimited, this is now my go to music app! Spotify does have more of a wealth of playlists, but I think Amazon will continue to improve in that regard.",1
2507,24-May-17,I didn't find all the music I had purchased but I did find some.,0
4865,21-Aug-15,I love the lyrics on screen for most of the songs and being able to skip through songs with no limitations.,1
6472,29-Jan-15,I really do love this music app but it can be a little confusing to use and not all the music is free.....,1
6356,1-Oct-14,The selections are pretty good. I might give it more stars if I was able to put the songs on other devices other than my cell phone.,1
1360,12-Oct-16,"I love this benefit of Prime membership! Free music, what's not to like?! If you have the Audible app, you can also listen to free audiobooks on ""Channels"".",1

3433,18-Nov-14,"Wouldn't want to be without it!!!! This app is the greatest of all the ones I own. It represents the quality and integrity of the company AMAZON. Jeff Besos had done a wonderful job in the implementation of this app and I don't think there is a more qualified person than him in running a HUGE ENTERPRISE like Amazon. He is truly to be commended for outstanding service ALL the time to each and every customer. I for one am very grateful!!!
 
 Being a Prime Member is my pleasure and enjoyment.",1
9895,13-Apr-15,LOVE it!!!,1

5765,9-Jul-15,love the available free music! I use Amazon music with Prime music as my iTunes on my ipad.,1
2055,13-Oct-11,"This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated.",1
9052,30-Mar-15,Love it. Another great part of prime.,1
2474,16-Jul-15,Nice,1
11799,11-Aug-15,"This is one of my favorite benefits of Prime!
 No extra cost to stream music from all genres commercial free. I listen on my laptop, kindle, and phone with perfect back to back flow, no issues of any kind. There are so many free choices available, that my playlist is pretty much neverending!
 Great free choices, great service!",1
2777,4-Sep-16,the product provides the opportunity to download and listen offline and no advertisement,1
1584,23-Jun-14,"After having to listen to more and more advertising on Pandora, I finally gave Amazon a try and it was great. I had to install a couple of different apps before I could download it, but once I did, we didn't turn it off all night. And two of my friends downloaded it at the same time and both of them are now permanent listeners too. Good app.",1
4547,4-Mar-15,"Like the file, it could use a more user
  friendly app,other than that the music sounds awesome.thank you p.s add some R&B music of the 70's n 80's",1
3672,21-May-15,Quality is great just not enough music choices and artists quantity is small. Once they get more it will easily be five stars. Love the lyrics no commercial.,1
5431,27-Jun-14,"it's pretty darn cool that I can listen to some of my favorite music either on my phone, on my PC, or on my tablet and all for free. My Prime membership is money well spent!!",1

3067,15-Oct-16,Looks easy but how do you pay and does it download to your device,0
1477,8-Oct-16,"Wow, this feature rocks! Any song you want streamed to any device plus hosts all the music you buy. Switched all my listening and streaming to this service.",1
11867,5-Sep-15,I love whole prime option. I am a disabled veteran that is home bound. I love music so the music part I really love. I have not got into the movie part yet but I plan to very soon. I bought a good blue tooth speaker that makes the music sound awesome. I wish this was all a little easier to work and learn. I have about 3500 songs but I know there are a lot of doubles. It would be nice to be able to have the app identify doubles and ask before before you down loaded it again. It seems like this might be something you want to control on your PC. I look forward to the movie part. I use prime to make purchases and I really like that part. Help to make the music more user friendly. Thanks,1
2044,22-Jul-15,"There are a lot of artists I can't get, otherwise it's great!",1

8902,11-Jun-15,Good for finding new music,1

1906,14-Sep-17,"Great Music selections, huge variety, and easy to use!",1
10997,26-Apr-11,"I have downloaded the app and on my Samsung Galaxy S I find I am connected to Amazon MP3 UK. UK? I live in the US. I can't find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they don't know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I don't want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.
 
 Great idea but the app isn't ready for prime time.",0
11614,24-Oct-14,Excellent,1

11065,9-Feb-13,"I love being able to carry my music everywhere I go without buy the same songs two or three times. This is an easy way to put songs onto multiple portable devices, and maintain them for long periods of time. You also don't have to buy the same tracks for each device which is convient.",1
5611,18-Jul-15,I love that I can just use the cloud to store all my music so I don't waist space on my phone!,1
7787,2-Dec-15,As advertised,1
629,3-Oct-17,Love it.,1
11756,22-Sep-15,I love Amazon and I love love Amazon prime music. I feel like there is actually another person on the other end who knows all the music I love and they just pick the best songs all day!!!it's crazy to find a Mac dre station. I also heard on the news recently that Amazon has spent around 100 million on letting their prime members stream music and movies add free and I just want to say thank you Amazon for being legit! I love this company and everything about it.,1
10879,2-Jul-14,poor sound,0
4271,22-Dec-15,It's included with Prime. It has some pretty decent music on it. It doesn't completely suck...,0
9691,18-May-15,it's good,1
105,20-Mar-17,good,1
3809,25-Aug-15,Uses data constantly. Even the music and videos I buy can't be saved to prevent excessive data usage. Why buy it if you never own it?,0
3822,12-Nov-15,I love the fact you can download the music to your device so you can play it off-line without messing with the DRM.,1

2056,28-May-17,I love this app! I can basically put in any song and they have it.,1
7101,29-Feb-16,Wonderful,1
11824,2-Oct-17,"Doesn't work properly with Android Auto. Your own playlists are unavailable, unless you want auto-generated playlist of what Amazon thinks you want to hear. Cannot use voice commands properly, either. Most times, if it responds at all, it gives you something wildly different from what you asked for. This is basic functionality and has apparently been broken for some time or has never worked. I know Amazon and Google don't play nice with each other, but removing basic functions from their service is ridiculous. If I'm paying for a music service, I should be able to listen to it wherever and however I like.",0
11849,1-Sep-17,"With my Amazon Prime account, this is my go to audio app. Plenty of ad free music and the ability to store them locally when in areas without service. The only down side is that they tease you with Unlimited for an extra fee on some of the best songs when you search for them and the stations start to repeat songs fairly quickly.",1
1441,2-Jun-16,It would be great if Amazon Music worked together Google cast.,0
3702,29-Feb-16,Love how I can have this on several devices and all sync up so I have my music with me always.,1
1211,22-Jan-17,"This app is great. Understand though, that the music you download is for ""trial"" not permanent. The songs last a long time but will disappear eventually.",1
4089,22-May-15,one of the best sites for music you can't find,1
1892,10-Apr-16,All I can do is see that I have purchased the app and cannot download to my android device! No directions are given and it is not an automatic download! What a crappy app!,0
4193,10-Nov-14,I love this program! It is not fancy and over complicated like so many others. I did have to uninstall the app and reinstall to be able to play all my songs but besides that love it,1
9410,10-Jun-15,Great choices,1
3963,7-Aug-14,I'm really jazzed to be able to download free songs from all the lists. Then I move them to my device to listen without using my data plan. Best of all Amazon offers tech help with this that's easy to use.,1
10733,25-Nov-12,It is hard to download purchased mp3s to my phone. The web page design prevented fully seeing the options and buttons.,1
3615,1-Aug-16,"Nice music app, I love that it comes with my prime membership.",1
4398,27-Jan-16,Great app for listening to my favorite music and even better for finding new music!,1

6343,22-Jul-15,"Havent us e d it much, i am however pleased its part of my prime membership",1
10959,16-Dec-13,"I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on. Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices. However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want. Also, I am always able to stream the music (when data connected) from the Amazon Cloud.
 
 Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!",1
7422,25-Jan-16,Excellent!,1
8744,26-Jun-15,Convenient and easy to use.,1
4770,7-Apr-16,It puts me to sleep at night and wakes me up to Diva Premal,1
2939,10-Aug-15,"good selection, easy to use format, unlimited skips with prime.",1
8099,24-Nov-15,Love it.,1
10014,29-Apr-12,We need to be able to set a music and meta data storage location for this app. Why have a giant SD card that we cant even store music on!,1
11563,25-Oct-14,Love the variety!,1
11842,23-Jan-17,"The best of music to your liking. Always has what you're looking for and always delivers great pleasure to hear what you choose to listen too.
 Because I have Prime, I get to pick so many songs without having to buy it, so my choices are endless. This was a genius development of great minds that got together to create something all and everyone could enjoy. It must have taken more than one mind, but if it was one man, wow!",1
5931,15-Mar-16,So far so good I would rate it as of 4,1
5369,29-Jan-16,I like because I can music i havent heard in a long time.,1

3925,15-Oct-16,Awesome! and works off the internet!,1
9310,22-Jul-15,O.keep.,1
3982,20-Jun-14,"It doesn't have everything that I have searched for, but I think it is good enough to replace Google Music for me. I wouldn't subscribe to Prime just for it, but it is a nice perk to go with my existing subscription.",0
6188,11-Apr-16,Perfect and thank you,1
6877,28-Feb-16,It's the best!,1
6246,30-Apr-15,"Forget all other streaming services, this is well worth the prime membership. THANKS Amazon!!!",1
5182,8-Jan-16,This is a great music app. Just wish it had a little more selection,1
10675,6-Nov-14,Awesome,1
7063,12-Mar-16,Awesome,1
3487,27-Mar-15,I love this feature. I have access to many different songsand can make my own play lists. I love having access to the free songs and being able to search different play lists.,1

3392,31-Jul-15,Works extremely well. Great seleection of music,1
7705,15-Nov-15,Amazon music rocks!,1
5416,24-Dec-14,"Good selections and the offered playlists are getting better. After all, this is still a new product for Amazon. For me, it beats Pandora",1
1902,22-May-13,I use this app constantly on my computer it is so much nicer than having to spend the computer memory space on iTunes!,1
7142,16-Feb-16,Great app!!,1
