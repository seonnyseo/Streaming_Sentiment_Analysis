15203,19-Dec-12,"Really the best radio station out there. I like all the indie stuff, and how it customizes your stations for you",1
17538,27-Jun-14,"I think the app is great. My only complaint about Pandora is that you can't pick specific song's or artists that you want to hear, they just match you up to song's similar to the song and artist of your choosing, which can be frustrating but it's better than the radio for background music and I knew what I was getting so I still gave a 5 star rating.",1
18910,14-Apr-12,As the title said its ok. its only good because it has free songs. but it didn't let me choose which songs I wanted. and the commercials are really annoying! I suggest songify,0

17761,8-May-12,"Panodora is a really great app and plays po the music I want, but my advice to you would be not to ""like"" the songs you like, because it takes it seriously plays that song over and over again. I promise that if you listen to the song area times it will recognize that you like it and play it more frequently. It never plays the songs that you dislike ,though, and that's always a good thing:)",1

16214,27-Dec-13,"I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer. I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it wouldn't take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up. Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound. I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour. I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to ""design"" a station.",1

1475,18-Mar-16,"I understand developers want money. It's business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly don't need my email address or login to operate. Pandora isn't one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it's not for me.
 
 Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download took forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required.",0

14627,21-Aug-14,"The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening - it may as well be listed & advertised as a freebie trial version. I've never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app. I would have to buy the ad-free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one.

I'm going to school online (while living in transitional housing), so I listen to Pandora as I work. The music is from years gone by (and from movies I've watched [i.e. Dirty Dancing to name one of them]). The other day I was listening to my music and heard a song that I used to love, but haven't heard for years. It is music that makes you want to dance or just move to the music.",1

Lovely, I was transported to the world of early music for a full afternoon while I painted from my Kindle. It has nicely followed my next entry, composer Nikolai Korsakov. Not a problem. Another afternoon of Russian romantic music, orchestral. How did I live without this?",1

896,21-Dec-13,"I've been an occasional listener to Pandora. I was recently talking to a friend about her music playing in the background since it was one well placed song after another. She told me it was Pandora and how ridiculously inexpensive it is, $36 a year! I signed up, noticed the advertising gone, but more, since I had put some cash on the line, I wanted to check out my purchase. I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station. How do you go so seamlessly from Dixie Chicks, through Norah Jones and Steve Winwood, to Journey, with perfect song selection from each?! Really invigorating! I'm hooked!! Thank you Pandora!

Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock). I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it's free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!",1

It's getting a little aggravating, because even though I like those songs, I don't want to hear the same ones in the same order every time I listen to a station. I've only noticed it happening on the Pop Rock radio I have, thankfully. Pandora often offers me a new song when I first click on the station, but it's usually a song I don't like (and I'm not holding that against them, of course). So I'll put a thumbs down.
